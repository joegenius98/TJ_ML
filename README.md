# TJ_ML 
My implementations for machine learning algorithms from the TJ Machine Learning Club. (https://tjmachinelearning.com)

These implementations were inspired by the TJ Machine Learning competitions, but I focus on "implementations" because I primarily focused on learning, rather than competing. The competitions had shell code which was helpful to get me started on my implemntations. For all of these implementations (except for decision trees), I could not get a chance to submit to the competition on time anyway. 

Complete: My decision tree and random forest were made from scratch, with the help of NumPy.

Incomplete: My support vector machine uses sklearn and my neural network uses a Python class and NumPy.
