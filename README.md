# TJ_ML
My implementations for machine learning algorithms from the TJ Machine Learning Club. (https://tjmachinelearning.com)

Complete: My decision tree and random forest were made from scratch, with the help of NumPy.

Incomplete: My support vector machine uses sklearn and my neural network uses a Python class and NumPy.
